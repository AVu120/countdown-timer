User can write the name of a future event then select the date and time it will start. A timer will then display the total time until that event starts and count down by 1 second intervals in real time. When the timer hits 0, an event notification will occur. User will then be prompted to change event name, select a new date and time and start the countdown again. Timer can be reset while running.
